## ðŸ’» Mini project of the week:  
**ðŸ“’ Custom Recipe App**  
The app allows users to add, edit, and delete their own recipes, which are stored in the browser using localStorage.
Each recipe is displayed as a styled card, and the form is reused for both creating and editing recipes.

I practiced DOM manipulation, working with localStorage, creating reusable functions, and designing a responsive layout.
This project helped me improve my ability to handle client-side data and user interactions without using a backend.
